## üîß Advanced Usage

### API Endpoints

#### Upload File
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@your_audio_file.mp3"
```

#### Train Model
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/train-real"
```

#### Ask Question (Text)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/interact" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "text=What is Vijayawada famous for?"
```

#### Ask Question (Audio)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/interact" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "audio=@your_question.wav"
```

#### Check Progress
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/progress"
```

### Programmatic Usage

#### Python Example
```python
import requests

# Upload file
with open('audio.mp3', 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload', files={'file': f})
    print(response.json())

# Train model
response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:8000/train-real')
print(response.json())

# Ask question
response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:8000/interact', 
                        data={'text': 'What is Vijayawada famous for?'})
print(response.json())
```

## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Check System Status
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/progress"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "is_training": false,
  "progress": 0,
  "trained": true,
  "artifact": "qa_system_ready"
}
```

### Server Logs
Monitor the backend server console for:
- Model loading status
- Training progress
- Error messages
- API request logs

### Common Status Messages
- `"Whisper model pre-loaded successfully!"` - Whisper ready
- `"QA model loaded successfully"` - QA model ready
- `"Training completed successfully!"` - Training done
- `"QA system is available, using it directly"` - System ready

## üéØ Best Practices

### Audio Quality
- Use clear, high-quality audio files
- Avoid background noise
- Speak clearly and at normal pace
- Use supported formats (MP3, WAV, M4A)

### Question Asking
- Ask specific, clear questions
- Use complete sentences
- Avoid ambiguous questions
- Be patient with processing time

### Performance
- Close other applications to free RAM
- Use shorter audio files for faster processing
- Restart server only when necessary
- Monitor memory usage

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Upload Fails
- Check file format (MP3, WAV, M4A only)
- Ensure file is not corrupted
- Check available disk space
- Verify file permissions

#### Training Fails
- Check server logs for error messages
- Ensure sufficient RAM available
- Verify internet connection for model downloads
- Check audio file quality

#### No Response to Questions
- Verify training completed successfully
- Check if content was transcribed properly
- Try different question phrasings
- Check server logs for errors

#### TTS Issues
- Verify Piper files are in correct location
- Check file permissions for Piper executable
- Ensure audio output is working
- Check server logs for TTS errors

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Server Status**
   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/progress"
   ```

2. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look for error messages in console
   - Check for model loading issues
   - Verify API endpoint responses

3. **Test Individual Components**
   - Test file upload separately
   - Test training separately
   - Test question asking separately

4. **Restart System**
   - Stop both servers
   - Clear any cached data
   - Restart servers
   - Try again

## üìà Performance Tips

### Memory Management
- Close other applications
- Use shorter audio files
- Monitor RAM usage
- Restart server if memory issues

### Processing Speed
- Use clear audio files
- Ask specific questions
- Avoid very long audio files
- Use SSD storage if available

### Accuracy Improvement
- Use high-quality audio
- Speak clearly
- Ask specific questions
- Use complete sentences

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Batch Processing
- Upload multiple files sequentially
- Each upload clears previous data
- Train after each upload
- Ask questions about each content

### Custom Models
- Modify model names in `main.py`
- Update model versions
- Test with different models
- Monitor performance changes

### Integration
- Use API endpoints in your applications
- Integrate with other systems
- Build custom frontends
- Extend functionality

## üìö Examples

### Example 1: Educational Content
1. Upload lecture audio
2. Train model
3. Ask: "What are the main topics covered?"
4. Ask: "Explain the key concepts"
5. Ask: "What examples were given?"

### Example 2: Meeting Notes
1. Upload meeting recording
2. Train model
3. Ask: "What decisions were made?"
4. Ask: "Who attended the meeting?"
5. Ask: "What are the action items?"

### Example 3: Interview Analysis
1. Upload interview audio
2. Train model
3. Ask: "What questions were asked?"
4. Ask: "What were the main responses?"
5. Ask: "What insights were shared?"
